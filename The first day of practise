I started with the classic easiest code: 
System.out.println("Hello World!");


an int variable example:
int x = 5;	
int y = 7;
int sum = x * y;
System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);


another int example:
another mathmatic example:
int num = 100;
System.out.println("This is num: " + num);
num = num * 2;
System.out.println("The value os num * 2 is: ");
System.out.println(num);


we can use var (variable) as well:
var x = 5;	
var y = 7;
var sum = x * y;
System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);


simple if statment:
int x, y;
x = 20;
y = 100;
if (x < y) {
	System.out.println("x is less than y");
}


Another if statment:
int x, y, z;
x= 20;
y= 20;
z = x * y ;
if(x == y) {
System.out.println(" they are equal");	
}


for loop:
int x;
for (x = 0; x <= 10; x ++) {
System.out.println("this is x: " + x);
}


While example:
int i = 6;
while (i < 6) {
System.out.println("Hello");	
i++;
}


long is intended to have 64 bits, while int has less than that,
int lightspeed;
long days;
long seconds;
long distance;


program that computes the number of miles that light will travel in a specified number of days:
int lightspeed;
long days;
long seconds;
long distance;

//approximate speed of light in miles per second:
lightspeed = 186000;
days = 1000; // this is the number of days.
seconds = days * 24 * 60 * 60;  // to convert to seconds
distance= lightspeed * seconds;

System.out.println("In " + days);
System.out.println("days light will travel about");
System.out.println(distance + "miles");

/* output: In 1000
days light will travel about
16070400000000miles */


compute the area of circle:
double pi, r, a;
		
r = 10.8; //radius of a circle
pi = 3.1416; //approximation of pi
a = pi * r * r; // computer area
		
System.out.println("Area of circle= " + a);
